# novia - NOstr VIdeo Archive

novia is the glue that connects video archive tools to NOSTR. It can be used
as a **standalone archive tool** or extend other open source tools like:

- tubearchivist
- pinchflat

novia is running as a service and is able to

- download videos (with `yt-dlp`) by REST API or requests posted via NOSTR.
- scan existing videos on disk downloaded by other tools
- manage a library of the video metadata
- publish video events to NOSTR relays and
- answer requests for videos and upload them to blossom server.

# Archive structure

novia follows a few simple rules:

- filesystem first - all video, image and metadata is stored in a folder structure.
- Archive contents can be therefore be synched, copied and backuped in a conventional way.
- The default folder structure is:
  ```sh
  <source>/<user or channel>/<videoId>/videoId.mp4 (the video)
  <source>/<user or channel>/<videoId>/videoId.webp (a thumbnail)
  <source>/<user or channel>/<videoId>/videoId.info.json (ytdlp metadata)
  ```
  A concrete example would be:
  ```sh
  youtube/UClw9f0QDkIw2jrQ2_5QSMGw/dnDC3uWjhlo/dnDC3uWjhlo.mp4
  youtube/UClw9f0QDkIw2jrQ2_5QSMGw/dnDC3uWjhlo/dnDC3uWjhlo.webp
  youtube/UClw9f0QDkIw2jrQ2_5QSMGw/dnDC3uWjhlo/dnDC3uWjhlo.info.json
  ```
- Other folder structures are supported as well, as long all the content files have a unique name
- novia uses an SQLlite database as an index but the database could be restored from metadata at any time.

# Components

- **Filesystem scan** scans defined folders for video and metadata.
- **Filesystem watcher** watches for changes in the folder and processes files immediately.
- **Metadata extension** if a video doesn't have a thumbail or metadata it is fetched and stored in the filesystem alongside the video.
- **Hashing** For every file a unique hash (SHA256) is created.
- **Download** new videos based on a link and add them to the archive.
- **Publish video events** of archived videos on NOSTR.
- **Offer download services** to other users via NOSTR DVMs.
- **Offer video upload services** to users requesting a specific video.

# Setting it up

## Running in Docker

To use docker to run novia you have to mount the media folders as well as a folder with the config and database into the container. The easiest setup is as follows:

- Create a `./data` folder
- Create a folder `./data/media` where the video content will go.
- Create a config file `./data/novia.yaml`:

  ````yaml
  mediaStores:
  - id: media
    type: local
    path: /data/media
    watch: true

  database: /data/novia.db

  download:
    enabled: true
    ytdlpPath: yt-dlp
    ytdlpCookies: ./cookies.txt
    tempPath: ./temp
    targetStoreId: media
    secret: false

  publish:
    enabled: true
    key: nsecxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    thumbnailUpload:
    - https://nostr.download
    videoUpload:
      - url: https://nostr.download
        maxUploadSizeMB: 300
        cleanUpMaxAgeDays: 5
        cleanUpKeepSizeUnderMB: 2
    relays:
      - <a relay for the video events>
    secret: false
    autoUpload:
      enabled: true
      maxVideoSizeMB: 100

  fetch:
    enabled: false
    fetchVideoLimitMB: 10
    match:
      - nostr

  server:
    port: 9090
    enabled: true

      ```

  **Notice:** The paths point to `/data/` here. The service will automatically look for the config file in `/data/novia.db` or `./novia.db`. For docker setups it is easiest to just mount the `/data` folder.
  ````

Now you can run docker to start the novia service:

```sh
docker run -it --rm -p 9090:9090 -v ./data:/data teamnovia/novia
```

or for running in background

```sh
docker run -it --rm -p 9090:9090 -v ./data:/data teamnovia/novia
```

Use the `-e DEBUG=novia*` for more debugging output in the logs.

## Running with nodejs locally

### Prerequsites

Required NodeJS version is 21 (novia relies on it's websocket client support)

There are a few tools that novia uses for video download, conversion and hash calculation.
It expects the following tools to be installed:

- yt-dlp (https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
- ffmpeg (https://ffmpeg.org/)
- shasum (https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/ usually preinstalled on most systems)

### Configuration

When running with nodejs there is a helpful init tool that helps you to create the config file:

```bash
npx novia init
```

After answering the questions you should get a `novia.yaml` that looks something like this:

```yaml
mediaStores:
  - id: media
    type: local
    path: ./media
    watch: true
database: ./novia.db
download:
  enabled: true
  ytdlpPath: yt-dlp
  tempPath: ./temp
  targetStoreId: media
publish:
  enabled: true
  key: nsec188j2c3e0tdk7w6vapd0fcdn0g9fq653vzpj2zufgwx659qt49euqjlwnu0
  thumbnailUpload:
    - https://nostr.download
  videoUpload:
    - url: https://nostr.download
      cleanUpKeepSizeUnderMB: 2
      cleanUpMaxAgeDays: 10
      maxUploadSizeMB: 500
  relays:
    - my-video-relay.org
server:
  enabled: true
  port: 9090
```

If the media folder that you have specified doesn't already exist, go ahead and create it now.

```sh
mkdir ./media
```

Then you can run `serve` to start the service and answer video requests.

```bash
npx novia serve
```

# Known issues / limitations

There are several issues that have not been solved yet, here the most important:

- Currently all running novia instances download a video triggered by an archive request. There is no coordination or circuit
  breaker, when someone else is downloading the video.
- There is currently no way to share an archived video with another
  archive (incl. metadata and thumbnail).
- All novia instances that download a video also publish the video, i.e. there will be
  multiple video events from different novia instances. Additional checks if a video already
  exists, might be needed.
- Blossom servers don't upload of support large files. A possible solution is chunking of
  files (cherry tree).
- There are not many blossom servers that support large amounts of content. This will hopefully
  be improved with payed blossom servers (soon).

# NOSTR events

## Video Events

Novia creates video events according to nip71 (https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/71.md) but with a few specifics:

- Videos created with novia are usually **not online**, i.e. the events are created without the video `url` but only with the `x` tag which contains the videos's sha256 hash. Clients have to try requesting the video's hash from known blossom servers.
- A c-tag `["c", "<channel name or uploader>", "author"]` is used to mark the
  original author, e.g. Youtube channel.
- Another c-tag `["c", "<source>", "source"]` is used to store the source website where this video was archived from. This is usually the `extractor` fields from `yt-dlp`.
- An `["l", "en", "ISO-639-1"]` is added to specify the language of the video if available.
- An additional tag `["info", "<hash>"]` is used to store a blossom hash for video metadata that is created by `yt-dlp`. This can be used to restore an archive entry with the full meta data information that is not contained in the nostr event.
